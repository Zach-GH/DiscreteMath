The two charts are equal. The first thing that I did was compare each of the graphs together. I made sure that A, B, C, D, and E were all present in both graphs to assess for any unknown or left out variables. After this, I then made sure that each variable could be connected to the latter in the right handed chart, by seeing if there were any additional connections between each variable, or if there were any that lacked any type of connection.

These two graphs are not equal. The first thing that I did was check the amount of vertices in both the matrix graph and pentagon. They both have 5 vertices meaning that they could be the same. Next I had to make sure that the matrix graph made sense. {1,3} = A to C, {3,1} = C to A, {4,1} and {1,4} = A to D and D to A, {3,4} and {4,3} = C to D and D to C, {2,5} and {5,2} = B to E and E to B, and then what makes these two graphs not equal are {4,5} and {5,4}. The reason this makes it not equal is that this would mean that D is connected to E which it is not, nor is E connected to D. Secondly, in the case that this were true, as the chart appears that it might be, then there would be additional indicators in the matrix chart to show that B and C or C and B are also connected, which there are not.

If you divide the vertices into two sets, which would equal K4 which would mean that there are at the very least 3 edges. Which means edge connectivity = 3. \\

Vertex connectivity is 1 as if you remove the 6th vertex then vertex 1 cannot get to vertex 8.

Again, if you divide 8 in half, then you have an edge connectivity of 3. We can see the application of this by eliminating 2 and either 7,5 or 3,6
\\

The vertex connectivity again is 2 because if you eliminate 7,5 or 3,6 then you will be stopping 1 and 8 from being connected to one another.

%Enter your answer below this comment line.
If we start the algorithm at vertex a, then we have to first create a T. This T would consist of the most incident edges to the originality point, which in this case is F, E, and B. We then select the minimum weighted edge which in this case is E which has a value of 2. This goes on to choose F, and then D. as those are the two next minimum weighted edges. This eliminates D \to E \\

because E is already in the tree. We now have a tree that looks like this. A \to E \to F \to D. \\

And we have eliminated D \to E \ and \ A \to F. \\

Lastly, the tree continues to branch from E \to C \ and \ C \to B \\

which cancels out A \to C \ and \ B \to A. 
\\

Giving us the minimum spanning tree using Prims algorithm.\\

\item How would you generalize this idea? Suppose you are given a graph G and a particular edge $\{u,\,v\}$ in the graph. How would you alter Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree subject to the condition that $\{u,\,v\}$ is in the tree?\\\\
%Enter your answer below this comment line.
According to Prims algorithm. Graphs have the ability to have more than one minimum spanning tree. In the case there is an inconclusive answer due to the fact that there are multiple trees available to be chosen, we equate the problem with every minimum spanning tree having n - 1 weight. In addition to this, every spanning tree is also a minimum spanning tree. The reason I believe this is the answer is due to the fact that graph G and the particular edge U, V in question are both theta without any actual content to distinguish between.
